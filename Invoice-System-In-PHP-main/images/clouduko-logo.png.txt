CLOUDUKO LOGO PLACEHOLDER

To add your CloudUko logo:
1. Create or obtain your company logo (PNG format recommended)
2. Resize it to approximately 300x90 pixels
3. Save it as "clouduko-logo.png" in this images folder
4. Delete this placeholder file

Until you add your logo, the system will show a broken image icon on the login page.
You can temporarily copy an existing logo file and rename it to clouduko-logo.png.
